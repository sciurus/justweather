## Description
This program creates a weather page inspired by the simpleweather.com. I wrote it in 2008 after that site shut down. It depends on Yahoo's weather API, which is only available for non-commercial use. The program expects a zip code as input and outputs an html file.

## Usage
    $ justweather.pl zip_code

## Requirements
  * LWP::Simple
  * XML::LibXML
  * XML::LibXSLT
